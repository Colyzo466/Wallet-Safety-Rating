# WalletSafetyRating Smart Contract

The **WalletSafetyRating** smart contract provides a decentralized framework for assessing the safety of Ethereum wallet addresses. It allows users to rate wallets, flag potentially malicious wallets, and track user reputations. This system is designed to create a safer ecosystem for Ethereum users by providing transparency and accountability.

## Features

- **Wallet Rating System**: Users can rate wallets with a score from 1 to 100 and leave comments.
- **Flagging System**: Users can flag wallets with reasons for suspicious activity.
- **Reputation Management**: Tracks the reputation of users based on their activity (valid/invalid flags).
- **Safety Levels**: Wallets are categorized as "Safe," "Caution," or "Unsafe" based on ratings and flag thresholds.
- **Admin Controls**: Admin can reset wallet profiles, update thresholds, and transfer admin roles.
- **Event Logging**: Emits events for actions such as wallet rating, flagging, and safety level updates.

## Smart Contract Details

### Deployment

To deploy the smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain:

1. **Set Up Environment**:
   - Install [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) or use a local development environment like Hardhat or Truffle.
   - Ensure you have an Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) and test ETH for gas fees.

2. **Compile the Contract**:
   - Paste the contract code into Remix IDE.
   - Compile using Solidity compiler version `^0.8.0`.

3. **Deploy**:
   - Select the appropriate network (e.g., Ethereum Testnet like Goerli).
   - Deploy the contract.

4. **Admin Setup**:
   - The deploying address will be assigned the admin role.

### Contract Configuration

- **Reputation Threshold**: The default threshold for marking wallets as "Unsafe" is 10 flags. This can be updated by the admin using `updateReputationThreshold()`.
- **Rating Expiry**: Ratings expire after 30 days by default.

## Front-End Integration

To provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the smart contract, create a front-end application using **React** and **TailwindCSS**.

### Key Functionalities

1. **Rate Wallets**:
   - Input wallet address, rating (1-100), and comment.
   - Call the `rateWallet` function.
2. **Flag Wallets**:
   - Input wallet address and reason for flagging.
   - Call the `flagWallet` function.
3. **View Wallet Profiles**:
   - Display wallet safety level, average score, rating count, and flags.
   - Use the `getWalletProfile` function.
4. **User Reputation**:
   - Show user reputation metrics using the `getUserReputation` function.

### Recommended Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **Blockchain Interaction**: Ethers.js or web3.js

### Example Code Snippet

```javascript
import { ethers } from "ethers";

const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);
const signer = provider.getSigner();
const contractAddress = "<DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>";
const abi = [ /* Contract ABI */ ];

const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, abi, signer);

async function rateWallet(walletAddress, rating, comment) {
    const tx = await contract.rateWallet(walletAddress, rating, comment);
    await tx.wait();
    console.log("Wallet rated successfully");
}
```

## Backend Integration

To enhance functionality, build a backend API to:

1. **Cache Data**:
   - Store wallet profiles, ratings, and flag data for quick retrieval.
   - Use frameworks like **Express.js** or **NestJS**.

2. **Scraping for Wallet Safety**:
   - Scrape blockchain explorers (e.g., Etherscan) for wallet activity patterns.
   - Integrate with external APIs to identify known scam wallets.

3. **Scheduled Updates**:
   - Regularly update wallet safety levels based on data from the blockchain and external sources.

4. **Database**:
   - Use **PostgreSQL** or **MongoDB** to store user and wallet data.

---

## Scraping and External Sources

To enrich wallet safety data:

- **Use Blockchain Explorers**:
   - APIs from Etherscan or similar services to fetch wallet history.
- **Integrate Scam Wallet Databases**:
   - Incorporate data from trusted platforms like ScamSniffer or Chainalysis.
- **Periodic Checks**:
   - Run cron jobs to update wallet safety levels periodically.

---

## Recommendations

1. **Security Audits**:
   - Conduct a smart contract audit before deployment.
2. **Gas Optimization**:
   - Minimize gas costs by optimizing storage usage.
3. **Scalability**:
   - Consider Layer 2 solutions (e.g., Arbitrum, Optimism) for better performance.
4. **User Education**:
   - Provide clear guidelines on how to interact with the system safely.
